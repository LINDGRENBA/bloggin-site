      <h1>Apocalypse Cooking: Meal Ideas from Isolation</h1>
      <h3>By: Brittany Lindgren</h3>

      <p>Below are a few of the things I've whipped up during my last two weeks of social distancing. Stay safe, wash your hands and for more information on how to protect yourself when bringing in groceries, read this <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2020/3/25/1931140/-Watch-a-doctor-demonstrate-how-to-safely-bring-groceries-home-during-the-coronavirus-crisis?detail=emaildkre&fbclid=IwAR0phYotU_iqpQedsJoJ91lUXTx4YCH2WjlAff9EzUOXif6LWANw0i2FOvM" target="_blank">Daily Kos article by Jen Hayden</a> and watch the featured video entitled "Watch a doctor demonstrate how to safely bring groceries home during the coronavirus crisis" </p>

    <h2>Sweet Potato Waffles</h2>

    <p>This <a href="https://www.whitneyerd.com/2016/01/healthy-sweet-potato-waffles.html">recipe for Healthy Sweet Potato Waffles</a> created by Whitney E. RD. was the perfect way to use up a couple of roasted sweet potatoes. Make it savory by adding cheese and a fried egg on top or go sweet with whipped cream and fresh fruit. Since I am a huge fan of breakfast meats in general, of course I have included a couple crispy slices of delicious bacon. Mmmm, bacon.</p>

  <div class="meal lunch">

    <h2>Korean Shrimp Porridge</h2>

    <p>After watching <a href="https://youtu.be/aH2BP-IXIec" target="_blank">Future Neighbor's YouTube video</a> for making Korean shrimp porridge, I couldn't wait to make some for myself. On Saturday, I slept in and then made myself a cup of coffee while taking my time to cook some up for myself.By the time I actually sat down to eat my first meal of the day, it was past noon, so that's why I feel like it's okay to include this as a lunch item, even though I believe it's intended to be for breakfast.</p>

  <div class="meal dinner">

    <h2>Kimchi Ramen</h2>
    <img src="img/ramen.jpg" alt="A bowl of Kimchi Ramen.">
    <p>Made using a packet of instant Ramen, I followed instructions for <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/kimchi-ramen/" target="_blank">Quick and Easy Kimchi Ramen</a> from The Woks of Life, which is a collaborative blog written by four family members. How cool is that! Although I wasn't able to follow this recipe to a T, I came pretty darn close and it was soooo satisfying. Hearty and filling, this is the very definition of comfort food. Perfect for the apocalypse.</p>

    <h2>A little bit about the author:</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest and love to travel. I've lived in Japan and visited France, Mexico and Hawaii. In addition to my love of travel, I enjoy good food and am rediscovering a joy for cooking and baking, which gives me something to do during isolation. I live with my husband and my dog, Gemma, who provides us with much entertainment and some cuddles (if we're lucky).</p>
